Memory Snapshot – 2025‑09‑09
---------------------------------

This file captures a concise snapshot of the context surrounding the creation of this repository.  It is *not* comprehensive; full case context resides in the annex ledger and associated documents.

* **Project:** Cosmic Seal Layer (CSL) seed for the GR‑11X‑MRL‑A1 archive.
* **Creator:** Matthew Russell LaBarre (independent researcher).  See `Stewardship` section in the arXiv paper for contact and licensing.
* **Purpose:** To provide a text‑first, accessible sealing workflow for digital artifacts.  The focus is on protocol‑only BangCheck blocks with optional courtesy digests and reproducible celestial contexts.
* **Variants:** CSL‑Min (minimal context), CSL‑Plus (ephemeris snapshot), CSP‑RK (true lunar node supplement).
* **Artifacts present:**
  - Seal images: Rahuyantra Omega (inward/outward) and additional variants.
  - OTP genesis layer used in earlier prototypes (`otp/OTP_GENESIS_LAYER.md`).
  - Schemas for CSL‑Min and CBARL event definitions.
  - Helper script for computing SHA‑256/384/512 digests.
* **Protocol rules:**
  - BangCheck blocks are *protocol‑only* and human readable.
  - Cryptographic digests are stored separately as sidecar files.
  - Annex ledger entries must be appended with each new seal.
  - All content should be ADA‑friendly and accessible (e.g. PDF/A wrappers for final deliverables).
* **Context:** This repository emerged from a larger discussion about building accessible, verifiable seals, aligning with the Cosmic Seal Protocol described in the accompanying arXiv submission.  It forms part of the evidence chain for case anchor EFCA2025001843.
